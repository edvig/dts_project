# Mobile APP

## To use MobX with build runner
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

alternative â†’ flutter packages pub run build_runner build

To application listen any changes in the code and run build runner, use this code

```dart
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

 If using vc code, there are a possibility to add the fluuter_mobx (from flutterando) extension.

If there are problems with generation, use the command:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
```
