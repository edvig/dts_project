# Software Requirements Specification

1.	**Introduction:** Basic, high-level overview of the project, with it's scope, target audience, etc.
2.	**System requirements, functional requirements:** System features with more details, 
3.	**External interface requirements:** The requirements for integration with external components, like user-, hardware-, software-, and communication interfaces.
4.	**Non-functional requirements:** All the requirements which implies on how the system should implement its features. Like security, capacity, compatibility, usability, reliability, scalability, etc.

### Introduction

This section should firstly describe the purpose of the product in a short overview. Then list the following things:

- **pruduct scope:** (business) goal of the project, benefits, objectives
- **product value:** why is it important? What will it bring to the users? What problem does it solve?
- **intended audience:** Who are we targetting with our product?
- **intended use:** Description of the way our product should be used.
- (table of contents, definitions, acronyms)

### System Requirements, functional requirements

This section can be more detailed with all the required functionalities and features of the system. These requirements should meet with the ones mentioned in the introduction. Should include things like:

- **data model & data handling logic**
- **system workflows**
- **use case diagrams**

### External interface requirements

Functional requirements which ensure that the product will communicate properly with the following interfaces:

- **user interfaces**
- **hardware interfaces**
- **software interfaces**
- **communication interfaces**

### Non-functional requirements

While functional requirements tell what the product will do, non-functional requirements tell how these features will be implemented. Like:

- **security**
- **capacity**
- **compatibility**
- **reliability & availability**
- **scalability**
- **maintainability**
- **usability**
